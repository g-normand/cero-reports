The bird of La Chocolatera belongs to the subspecies Oreopholus ruficollis pallidus as it showed pale buffy scapulars and wing-coverts with very thin black central stripes (nominate O. r. ruficollis has much broader, darker lines over a richer, deeper creamy background). It also had a paler grey crown, back and breast compared with the nominate form (Schulenberg et al., 2007). The subspecific identity of Ecuadorian birds has not been fully resolved, but Ridgely & Greenfield (2001) suggested they were O. r. pallidus. Subspecific identity of the two 1898 specimens, as well as of the Galápagos bird has to be determined.

The voice matches other recordings of Lurocalis semitorquatus semitorquatus, being notably different from L. s. nattereri (Fig. 7), the only subspecies previously recorded in E Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield, 2001). Calls of L. s. nattereri are much longer (0.2–0.3 s) than that of L. s. semitorquatus (about 0.03–0.04 s) (Fig. 7). Voices of the nominate subspecies are very similar to those of western subspecies L. s. stonei and L. s. noctivagus (Moore et al., 2013; Fig. 7), but their occurrence in the Amazonian lowlands seems less likely. In the light of the Peruvian records (Schulenberg et al., 2007) of L. s. semitorquatus, we believe that this subspecies, and not trans-Andean L. s. stonei or L. s. noctivagus, is expected to occur in SE Ecuador. Lurocalis s. noctivagus has been synonymised with L. s. stonei by Cleere (2016).

Ahlman at San Pablo in 2016 (Ahlman, 2016b) and further south, at Laguna Micacocha by R. Ahlman in April 2017 (Ahlman, 2017b). White cheeks, variable individually, make these individuals assignable to the subspecies O. j. andina, not previously recorded in Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield, 2001; McMullan & Navarrete, 2017, Arteaga-Chávez, in press.; but see below). It seems likely that this form is spreading south from central Colombia, but it remains to be determined if a local population is established (or establishing) in northern Ecuador, or if these individuals were only vagrants. The distribution of O. jamaicensis andina in Ecuador is currently under revision by W. Arteaga-Chávez (in press.). Co-occurrence of black-headed individuals assignable to O. j. ferruginea and white- cheeked ones assignable to O. j. andina in two localities in northern Ecuador is not novel because similar patterns are regular in the Central and Eastern Andes of Colombia (Fjeldså, 1986; Donegan et al., 2015), but still remarkable given the controversial taxonomic status of both forms (Madge & Burn, 1988; Livezey, 1995). Variation in cheek pattern is considerable throughout the range of O. j. andina (del Hoyo et al., 2018), suggesting that this region is an old, wide hybrid zone (a hybrid swarm; Fjeldså, 1986; Livezey, 1995). Consequently, the validity of subspecies O. j. andina has been questioned. Some authors consider it a valid subspecies of O. jamaicensis (Clements et al., 2017), while others regard it as a hybrid that justifies lumping O. jamaicensis and O. ferruginea as a single species, because andina acts as an intergraded form between white- cheeked jamaicensis and black-headed ferruginea (Fjeldså, 1986; McCracken & Sorenson, 2005; Muñoz- Fuentes et al., 2013; Donegan et al., 2015). Conversely, other authors suggest separating O. jamaicensis and O. ferruginea, but invalidate the subspecies andina due to its putative hybrid origin (Livezey, 1995; del Hoyo et al., 2018).

Plumage and vocal characters of birds in the Amazon lowlands correspond to subspecies T. sulphurescens insignis, previously known from riparian habitats in Loreto Department, northeast Peru, and adjacent western Brazil (Clements et al., 2017). Contra Schulenberg & Parker (1997), T. sulphurescens insignis concurs with Orange-eyed Flycatcher T. traylori in the Napo region, including records in Sacha Lodge and possibly other localities along the Río Napo.

These two subspecies have largely pale mandibles, and M. s. ferocior has a distinctly masked appearance (Freile & Restall, 2018).

It died afterwards, but the specimen was not secured and no necropsy analysis was done. This constitutes the first record for Ecuador and the northernmost record for the genus and species, c. 440 km north of Lobos de Tierra, the nearest coastal area where recorded in Peru, even though it has not bred there for several decades (Figueroa, 2013). The closest breeding colony lies 370 km further southeast of Lobos de Tierra, at Isla Corcovado (Valverde-Romero, 2006). This Humboldt Current species likely breeds year-round in coastal areas and islands of Peru and Chile (Howell & Zufelt, 2019; BirdLife International, 2020) and is considered to be sedentary (Onley & Scofield, 2007). The species is not known to wander or disperse over long distances under normal climatic conditions (Carboneras et al., 2020), but it is affected by abnormal climatic situations, because it feeds mostly on small pelagic fish that are more susceptible to changes in sea surface temperature (Brooke, 2004; García-Godos & Goya, 2006). Therefore, its dispersion northwards to the southern coast of Ecuador might have been caused by the weak cold- water event La Niña, as part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), that produced nutrient-rich and cooler water conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific from late 2016 to early 2017 (L’Heureux et al., 2017). With cold ocean waters being more productive, this P. garnotii might have travelled north in search for prey, as has been hypothesized for other marine organisms (Álava & Carvajal, 2005; Páez-Rosas et al., 2018). Nonetheless, we cannot fully rule out the possibility of a boat-assisted arrival to the Ecuadorian coast because diving-petrels often land on ships when attracted by lights (Howell & Zufelt, 2019)."},{"speciesCode":"woosto","comName":"Wood Stork","province":"Pichincha","locId":"L4815097","locName":"Reserva Mashpi Shungo","howMany":"1","obsDt":"9 November 2015","lat":"0.1824","lng":"-78.91215","cero_report":"5","altitude":"520","subId":"NO_EBIRD","userDisplayName":"A.

It is not known if this individual remained in the area because observations were limited to a single day. This is the first record for Ecuador and South America (Remsen et al., 2020) and comes on an unexpected date. The species winters in Central America, south to westernmost Panamá and adjacent Costa Rica, from where it departs by late March through April (Hudon, 2020). Previous records outside its typical wintering range or breeding grounds during the boreal spring are confined to northern United States and central-east Canada (Hudon, 2020). The southernmost record comes from Finca Velásquez, Veraguas, Panamá (Groenendijk, 2018), 850 km north-northwest of Reserva Otongachi, whereas the closest record to South America comes from the island of Bonaire (Wells & Childs-Wells, 2002). The mechanism by which this individual arrived to northwest Ecuador cannot be determined with certainty, but two possibilities stand out. First, it could represent an overshooting migrant, which might have passed its normal winter grounds during fall migration and overwintered in Ecuador while remaining undetected. However, considering the late date and the tendency of the species to vacate southern wintering areas in March and April (Hudon, 2020), it seems more plausible that this individual engaged in reverse migration as a result of misorientation. It has been proposed that a small number of individuals in migratory species depart their wintering grounds in a 180° reverse direction, just as some individuals seem to do when departing their breeding grounds (Howell et al., 2014). From many points in the core wintering range of P. ludoviciana along the Pacific slope of Central America, the area in northwest Ecuador where this individual was found lies on a straight 180° directly opposite the species' breeding areas in North America."},{"speciesCode":"dickci","comName":"Dickcissel","province":"Esmeraldas","locId":"L2761796","locName":"Las Peñas","howMany":"1","obsDt":"12 October 2015","lat":"1.1","lng":"-79.15","cero_report":"5","altitude":"0","subId":"S25398261","userDisplayName":"R.
