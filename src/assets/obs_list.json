The species was previously recorded just once, also in Santa Cruz (Brinkhuizen & Nilsson, 2020). Given that Q. mexicanus is not known to be a long-distance migrant and there is regular shipping traffic between Galápagos and Guayaquil, where the species is a common resident, it is assumed that the species has only arrived on the islands by ship. Therefore, it is not considered to be a naturally-occurring member of the resident or transient avifauna of the archipelago.

The underwing pattern was also photographed and excludes Common Snipe G. gallinago. Orcés [22] reported the first record of G. delicata from Ecuador based on a voucher specimen collected at Mapoto, province of Tungurahua, in October 1939; however the specimen is currently lost [23].
