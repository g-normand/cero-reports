The previous mainland record for Ecuador was in 1898, when two birds were collected in Santa Elena Peninsula, one of them labeled as immature (Salvadori & Festa, 1900). There is in addition a single observation of a bird photographed on Isla Española, Galápagos, on 23 June 1991 (Ridgely & Greenfield, 2001). The bird of La Chocolatera belongs to the subspecies Oreopholus ruficollis pallidus as it showed pale buffy scapulars and wing-coverts with very thin black central stripes (nominate O. r. ruficollis has much broader, darker lines over a richer, deeper creamy background). It also had a paler grey crown, back and breast compared with the nominate form (Schulenberg et al., 2007). The subspecific identity of Ecuadorian birds has not been fully resolved, but Ridgely & Greenfield (2001) suggested they were O. r. pallidus. Subspecific identity of the two 1898 specimens, as well as of the Galápagos bird has to be determined.

Species identification was based on: 1) pale gray inner primaries forming a contrasting pale window against darker secondaries and outer primaries [separating it from all subspecies of Lesser Black-backed Gull L. fuscus, California Gull L. californicus, which has darker primaries with only a faint window, and Slaty-backed Gull L. schistisagus, which has pale webs on the outer primaries; see Howell & Dunn, 2007]; 2) dark markings on the tips of the inner webs of primaries 1-3; 3) smoky, uniform underparts, neck and mantle especially on mid-belly, without any obvious streaking, lining or spots; 4) undertail coverts broadly barred blackish, with thinner and paler off-white bars (separating it from other taxa in the Herring Gull complex, which normally has darker bars thinner than pale ones; this also rules out Slatybacked Gull and Western Gull L. occidentalis); 5) heavily barred uppertail coverts with fairly broad dark bars, with the darker bars being broader than the paler ones; 6) mainly dark blackish tail with some paler mottling on the outer web of the outermost rectrices; 7) black bill with pale base to the lower mandible; 8) mainly dark tertials with paler fringes/notches on the tips only; 9) dark smudgy brown on the mantle and lower neck, contrasting with paler head; 10) irregular pattern on the scapulars; 11) a hint of a darker bar on the greater coverts on one wing; 12) irregular pattern on the wing coverts (see Howell & Dunn, 2007). There is a single previous record of an adult-plumaged individual seen at the Napo River upstream of La Selva lodge on 13 February 1991 (Ridgely & Greenfield, 2001). A photograph of apparently the same individual, taken by J. M. Carrión at Cumbayá reservoir, was published by Cisneros-Heredia et al. (2015). These observations in the Quito area represent the first documented records for Ecuador. The photographed individual belonged to the North American Larus argentatus smithsonianus subspecies, which is often considered as a separate species from the European Herring Gull L. argentatus (Crochet et al., 2002).",

A later analysis of the audio recording (Krabbe, 1996b), revealed that it is attributable to the nominate subspecies. The voice matches other recordings of Lurocalis semitorquatus semitorquatus, being notably different from L. s. nattereri (Fig. 7), the only subspecies previously recorded in E Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield, 2001). Calls of L. s. nattereri are much longer (0.2–0.3 s) than that of L. s. semitorquatus (about 0.03–0.04 s) (Fig. 7). Voices of the nominate subspecies are very similar to those of western subspecies L. s. stonei and L. s. noctivagus (Moore et al., 2013; Fig. 7), but their occurrence in the Amazonian lowlands seems less likely. In the light of the Peruvian records (Schulenberg et al., 2007) of L. s. semitorquatus, we believe that this subspecies, and not trans-Andean L. s. stonei or L. s. noctivagus, is expected to occur in SE Ecuador. Lurocalis s. noctivagus has been synonymised with L. s. stonei by Cleere (2016). Notably, L. s. nattereri has been recorded at Kapawi (Krabbe, 1996a; 1996c), c. 150 km southeast of Canelos.",

Ahlman at San Pablo in 2016 (Ahlman, 2016b) and further south, at Laguna Micacocha by R. Ahlman in April 2017 (Ahlman, 2017b). White cheeks, variable individually, make these individuals assignable to the subspecies O. j. andina, not previously recorded in Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield, 2001; McMullan & Navarrete, 2017, Arteaga-Chávez, in press.; but see below). It seems likely that this form is spreading south from central Colombia, but it remains to be determined if a local population is established (or establishing) in northern Ecuador, or if these individuals were only vagrants. The distribution of O. jamaicensis andina in Ecuador is currently under revision by W. Arteaga-Chávez (in press.). Co-occurrence of black-headed individuals assignable to O. j. ferruginea and white- cheeked ones assignable to O. j. andina in two localities in northern Ecuador is not novel because similar patterns are regular in the Central and Eastern Andes of Colombia (Fjeldså, 1986; Donegan et al., 2015), but still remarkable given the controversial taxonomic status of both forms (Madge & Burn, 1988; Livezey, 1995). Variation in cheek pattern is considerable throughout the range of O. j. andina (del Hoyo et al., 2018), suggesting that this region is an old, wide hybrid zone (a hybrid swarm; Fjeldså, 1986; Livezey, 1995). Consequently, the validity of subspecies O. j. andina has been questioned. Some authors consider it a valid subspecies of O. jamaicensis (Clements et al., 2017), while others regard it as a hybrid that justifies lumping O. jamaicensis and O. ferruginea as a single species, because andina acts as an intergraded form between white- cheeked jamaicensis and black-headed ferruginea (Fjeldså, 1986; McCracken & Sorenson, 2005; Muñoz- Fuentes et al., 2013; Donegan et al., 2015). Conversely, other authors suggest separating O. jamaicensis and O. ferruginea, but invalidate the subspecies andina due to its putative hybrid origin (Livezey, 1995; del Hoyo et al., 2018). The taxonomy of these taxa needs further clarification. ",

They generally perched at mid-levels and in understory, as well as around openings at the lodge’s river-edge landing area. First noticed when four birds were interacting, either two territorial pairs or family members. They responded territorially to playback of their own vocalizations. The next day, a pair was encountered in understory, but after playback, the presumed male sang from the upper mid-story. Photos are uploaded at the observer’s personal online archive https://www.flickr.com/photos/ 8013969@N03/16417378107/in/photostream/. This represents the first record of T. sulphurescens in the Amazonian lowlands of Ecuador, since the species has previously been reported in the east Andean foothills to subtropics (subspecies T. s. confusus and T. s. peruvianus) and western lowlands to subtropics (subspecies T. s. aequatorialis; Freile & Restall, 2018). Plumage and vocal characters of birds in the Amazon lowlands correspond to subspecies T. sulphurescens insignis, previously known from riparian habitats in Loreto Department, northeast Peru, and adjacent western Brazil (Clements et al., 2017). Contra Schulenberg & Parker (1997), T. sulphurescens insignis concurs with Orange-eyed Flycatcher T. traylori in the Napo region, including records in Sacha Lodge and possibly other localities along the Río Napo. It seems plausible that these two taxa segregate by habitat when syntopic. A thorough assessment of geographic variation in T. sulphurescens might reveal that several subspecies, including T. s. insignis, deserve species status (Ridgely & Greenfield, 2001; Fitzpatrick et al., 2004).

However, there are no records along this river in northern Peru, but an increasing influx of records in the southern Colombian Amazon (eBird, 2018), which suggests it as the actual immigration pathway. Furthermore, one bird was seen perching temporarily at the canopy walkway of Sacha Lodge (Lilley, 2019), suggesting that M. rixosa is able to disperse over vast tracts of forest.",

The species is a year-round breeding resident in Sacha Lodge, as indicated by calls of recently fledged juveniles available in Moore et al. (2013) and regular territorial singing. However, no nests have yet been found. Additional recordings from the same locality are available in Xeno-Canto (Lysinger, 1995; XC 260956, 260957; Lane, 2015b; XC 214547), as well as from nearby Añangu (Moore, 2005; XC 258958). Photos have been uploaded at the observer’s personal online archive (https://www.flickr.com/photos/8013969@N03/16598858736/in/photostream/). The species was previously known as an austral migrant to Amazonian Ecuador, found from April through September, with two subspecies recorded (M. s. ferocior and M. s. swainsoni) (Ridgely & Greenfield, 2001; Freile & Restall, 2018). These two subspecies have largely pale mandibles, and M. s. ferocior has a distinctly masked appearance (Freile & Restall, 2018). Slight plumage and soft part color differences suggest that M. s. phaeonotus is the subspecies breeding in Ecuador. This subspecies ranges mainly in southeast Venezuela, western Guyana, and northern Brazil (Fitzpatrick et al., 2004), with the closest records in Amazonas State, Brazil (B. M. Whitney, unpubl.) and Mitu Department, Colombia (Spencer, 2011). It remains to be determined if breeding birds in Amazonian Ecuador (and likely Colombia and northern Peru) are actually M. s. phaeonotus or an undescribed cryptic taxon. Until its status is further investigated, we accept this record as M. s. phaeonotus.  ",

Dark chestnut/rufous forehead, similar in tone to throat and sides of head, was noticed in both individuals, and clearly separated them from other whitish/pale fronted individuals seen at the same site (most likely nominate subspecies); these pale-fronted birds were larger than the two chestnut-fronted individuals. One additional record of a chestnut-fronted P. pyrrhonota was obtained by R. Ahlman at Lago San Pablo on September 2018 (Ahlman, 2018a). These birds might represent either subspecies P. pyrrhonota melanogaster, which is the subspecies to which chestnut-fronted birds seen in Ecuador have previously been assigned (Freile et al., 2013; 2017), or P. p. tachina since some individuals of this subspecies might show dark foreheads, yet somewhat paler than throat and sides of head (Sibley, 2014).

The latter subspecies differs from the former by its large blackish spots mainly on the belly. However, the visible portion of the lower breast is plain cinnamon, suggesting that it belongs to the boreal migrant subspecies (Fjeldså & Krabbe, 1990); the January date also fits for a boreal migrant.

pedpet1,Peruvian Diving-Petrel,,"Guayas Province, Puerto Engabao, 14 January 2017, F.

It died afterwards, but the specimen was not secured and no necropsy analysis was done. This constitutes the first record for Ecuador and the northernmost record for the genus and species, c. 440 km north of Lobos de Tierra, the nearest coastal area where recorded in Peru, even though it has not bred there for several decades (Figueroa, 2013). The closest breeding colony lies 370 km further southeast of Lobos de Tierra, at Isla Corcovado (Valverde-Romero, 2006). This Humboldt Current species likely breeds year-round in coastal areas and islands of Peru and Chile (Howell & Zufelt, 2019; BirdLife International, 2020) and is considered to be sedentary (Onley & Scofield, 2007). The species is not known to wander or disperse over long distances under normal climatic conditions (Carboneras et al., 2020), but it is affected by abnormal climatic situations, because it feeds mostly on small pelagic fish that are more susceptible to changes in sea surface temperature (Brooke, 2004; García-Godos & Goya, 2006). Therefore, its dispersion northwards to the southern coast of Ecuador might have been caused by the weak cold- water event La Niña, as part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), that produced nutrient-rich and cooler water conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific from late 2016 to early 2017 (L’Heureux et al., 2017). With cold ocean waters being more productive, this P. garnotii might have travelled north in search for prey, as has been hypothesized for other marine organisms (Álava & Carvajal, 2005; Páez-Rosas et al., 2018). Nonetheless, we cannot fully rule out the possibility of a boat-assisted arrival to the Ecuadorian coast because diving-petrels often land on ships when attracted by lights (Howell & Zufelt, 2019).

Dates of the three records, and this individual’s extended residence at Pacoa, suggest a tendency of this species to establish itself temporarily at new localities after post-breeding dispersal, and to complete pre-basic molt before migrating back to its breeding grounds.

It is not known if this individual remained in the area because observations were limited to a single day. This is the first record for Ecuador and South America (Remsen et al., 2020) and comes on an unexpected date. The species winters in Central America, south to westernmost Panamá and adjacent Costa Rica, from where it departs by late March through April (Hudon, 2020). Previous records outside its typical wintering range or breeding grounds during the boreal spring are confined to northern United States and central-east Canada (Hudon, 2020). The southernmost record comes from Finca Velásquez, Veraguas, Panamá (Groenendijk, 2018), 850 km north-northwest of Reserva Otongachi, whereas the closest record to South America comes from the island of Bonaire (Wells & Childs-Wells, 2002). The mechanism by which this individual arrived to northwest Ecuador cannot be determined with certainty, but two possibilities stand out. First, it could represent an overshooting migrant, which might have passed its normal winter grounds during fall migration and overwintered in Ecuador while remaining undetected. However, considering the late date and the tendency of the species to vacate southern wintering areas in March and April (Hudon, 2020), it seems more plausible that this individual engaged in reverse migration as a result of misorientation. It has been proposed that a small number of individuals in migratory species depart their wintering grounds in a 180° reverse direction, just as some individuals seem to do when departing their breeding grounds (Howell et al., 2014). From many points in the core wintering range of P. ludoviciana along the Pacific slope of Central America, the area in northwest Ecuador where this individual was found lies on a straight 180° directly opposite the species' breeding areas in North America.
